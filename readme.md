# OpenVSP Git Model Repo (GMR)

This repository is a collection of OpenVSP models that you can download and use in your projects.
This is a temporary solution to allow the community to continue to have share open source models.

## What is OpenVSP?

OpenVSP (Vehicle Sketch Pad) is a geometry modeling tool for conceptual aircraft design. The models in this repository are in the `.vsp3` format, which is the native format for OpenVSP. [Download it here](https://openvsp.org/download.php)

Clone the repository to your machine and you should have access to all the files.

## How to Push Models

2. Add your `.vsp3` model file in a folder with the model name. See the examples already in the folder.
